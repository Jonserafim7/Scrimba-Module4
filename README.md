CSS essencial concepts

concepts that we've learnt in this project:

-Semantic HTML to make our layout more accessible (using tags like <main>, <section>, <header> and <footer>)

-Hover and active states using pseude selector (a:hover,a:active, for example)

-When to use <a> (navigation) or <button>(triggering some kind of interactivity)

-Specificity (point system)

-Compound selectors (and when to avoid them); a compound selector is when youreference the parent of a given element and then the element iself, for example: 

section, a {

} 

In this example above we are only applying changes to the style of the anchor tags that are inside the section;

-Inline-block (behaves like an inline element, but lets you use margin and height, for example, like a block element)

-Multiple classes on one element (very useful to keep the css nice and tidy)
